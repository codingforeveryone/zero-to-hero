#### MY GUIDE TO AUTHORING NEW KATA ON CODEWARS
This entry is not intended as a means of establishing myself as an authority on this matter. Having just authored my 6th Kata, I thought I'd take a moment to make a note of my thoughts on the processes involved in a Kata'a birth on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com). This entry will reflect on what it takes for a Kata to make it out of [Beta status](http://www.codewars.com), what makes a Kata popular and how to conceive an original idea for a Kata. Everything that's written here is nothing more than my own personal opinion on a subject in which I only have four weeks' experience, so please feel free to contribute your own thoughts and ideas!

##Think of an idea                   ![](https://ramblingrhinos.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking-44121810.jpg)
This might easily be the part of the process that takes the longest. Coming up with an idea for a Kata, let alone a good one, is all about balance. Balance between originality, complexity and your objective. I'll come to each of these three points in a moment, but first I'd like to share with you how I find a Kata idea. 

I like to imagine a hypothetical use for the Kata in a real life computer system or application. I draw upon my own personal knowledge and think about which bits could be interpreted through code. As a linguist and a musician, I naturally turn towards languages and music for inspiration. I identify particular patterns and rules within my chosen field and try to imagine them interpreted in JavaScript. For example, in the [last Kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/how-to-pronounce-french/train) I wrote, I picked a pronunciation rule for which I couldn't think of any exceptions. I thought about how I could most easily have 'any word' as an input for my function. By identifying each word's final letter as the dependent variable, I was able to narrow my inputs down to 26 possibilities (each different letter of the alphabet). I used a similar technique in [this Kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/dont-get-stressed/train) which deals with finding the stress in multi-syllabic English words. In this case, I defined each word/input by it's word ending, meaning I had to declare all the possible inputs in my description. Looking back, I think there are elements of this approach which conflict with authoring a *successful* Kata (i.e. a Kata that makes it beyond Beta into battles that count in the Codewar context of points and ranking) and I shall deal with these before the end.

##Originality                          ![](http://calibermag.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/chickenoriginal1.jpg)
How important is originality in authoring a successful Kata? Sorting Kata by popularity after clicking the [Kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages) icon in the left-hand navigation bar tells us that, to a certain extent, it does! Take [this Kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/jaden-casing-strings) as an example. Based on [an actor's Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/officialjaden), the appeal of this Kata is that it can be conceptualised in a real-world context. 

##Complexity
A Kata's complexity takes on a dual nature. There is, on the one hand, the complexity of the description, and on the other, the complexity of the solution required. Regarding the latter, the beauty of JavaScript and of coding in general, is that there is always a myriad of different ways of solving a problem, some more complex than others. Essentially, however complex / simple you think your Kata is, there is always someone else who solves it in a more / less complex / simple way! Back to the description and a point I wanted to come back to from my own Kata examples, I think the simpler and shorter the description, the better the Kata. Looking back on Katas I created like [this one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/how-to-pronounce-french/train) and [this one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/dont-get-stressed/train), I think the chosen concepts require too much explanation to hold the attention of the code warrior for enough time to persuade him or her to take on the challenge. Having said this, there are probably code warriors out there who enjoy a good long read before diving in, but they're probably in the minority. The only Kata I have authored to come out of Beta so far is [this one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-arpeggiator/train) based on the arpeggio attached to the root note of a musical scale. I think the relative success of this one is due in no small way to the simplicity of the description. Similarly, I think [this one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/make-techno/train) might also have the potential to join it's musical cousin, 'The Arpeggiator', beyond Beta thanks to a relatively quick description.

##Objective
Finally, you have to ask yourself, what do you want the code warrior to do? What do you want the code warrior to learn from taking on your challenge? Getting the code warrior to solve your kata in a particular way can be done through instructions in the description like [this one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/javascript-filter-2) or [this one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/javascript-filter-3). There are also ways to channel the solution method through code, but I have not yet found away to achieve this.
